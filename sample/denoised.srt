1
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:15,831
Fate. Dreams. These unstoppable ideals are held deep 
in the heart of man. As long as there are people who seek

2
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:27,878
freedom in this life, these things shall not vanish 
from the earth.

3
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:59,350
People tell me my head's in the clouds I don't care what 
they say because I'm dreaming of you You are the

4
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:59,350
treasure I found So bright, so bold, it's so elusive 
It's hard to look away Even though it's blinding me

5
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:59,350
There are no words to describe how I feel inside I'm 
really, really stuck on you I have to follow my dreams,

6
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,900
however crazy they seem. And I won't stop till I get 
there, you will see. You're all I need to have the

7
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,800
strength to believe. Believe in one.

8
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:21,267
I'm going to follow my dreams, however crazy they 
seem. I'm going to share them with you, a love so true.

9
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:30,238
You're all I want, together we can move on, live how we 
want to. There is no limit to us, we have the power of

10
00:01:30,678 --> 00:01:34,303
love. We don't want to live ordinary lives. We have the 
chance to live in paradise.

11
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,292
What's wrong, huh? You've had that brooding look on 
your face for a while. Yeah, I guess I hoped I was

12
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:15,060
dreaming. About what? This may sound crazy, but it 
seems to me we're not even moving. You feel that?

13
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:31,369
Now that you mention it, the sail doesn't appear to be 
catching any wind at all.

14
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,641
No! We're screwed! We better the calm belt! The clam 
belt? What's that? Calm belt! A part of the sea where

15
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,914
nothing moves the muscles! So there's muscles and 
clams? No!

16
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:51,850
What was that? An earthquake? A good trick since we're 
at sea. All of this chitchat isn't going to get us out of

17
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:56,906
here. Fold the sails and start paddling now. We have to 
get back on course. You can count on me. Don't panic.

18
00:03:03,213 --> 00:03:04,975
And besides, this is a sailboat. Why do we need to 
paddle? True. Look, there's no time to argue. Just

19
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,142
shut up and do as I say. At least it's nice and quiet 
here. Oh, fine. If I need to explain it to you, I will. In

20
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:20,314
our haste to escape from the Marines, we ended up going 
too far south, and now we're off course and stuck out

21
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:20,314
here. So we enter the Grand Line? Woo-hoo-hoo! If we 
were at the Grand Line, you think I'd waste my time

22
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:27,566
explaining this? Now look. The Grand Line is 
sandwiched in the middle between these two green

23
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:34,319
areas you see here. You understand? These areas, just 
as they're labeled, are what's called the Calm Belt.

24
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:41,012
That's where we are. Nobody knows why, but inside the 
Calm Belt, there's no wind and no current. It's like a

25
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,603
void where everything's stagnant. Given that 
sailboats move by catching winds, this is more than a

26
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:51,870
dangerous region. It can be fatal, get it? Nope, but it 
sounds like we're in big trouble. Well, that explains

27
00:03:56,365 --> 00:03:59,129
why we haven't gotten a single gust of wind. How are we 
gonna get out of this if our ship can't move? Maybe the

28
00:04:01,773 --> 00:04:03,817
wind will start blowing again. Wind never blows in the 
Calm Belt. And that's not all. There's another good

29
00:04:07,182 --> 00:04:10,167
reason that people call this area dangerous. It's 
infested with... What was that?

30
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:23,267
Here they go!

31
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:32,667
You monsters! They're gigantic!

32
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,624
The Calm Belt is also home to the Sea Kings! It's their 
main place for breeding! They're the biggest reason

33
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,073
people can't cross the Calm Belt! Any idea how we get 
out of this? Yes. Everybody, don't move a muscle. We

34
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:58,806
don't want to give them any reason to stick around or 
eat us. Once they're gone, we'll paddle back. Got it?

35
00:05:01,188 --> 00:05:05,993
You call that a plan?

36
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:06,313
Shut up! Sorry.

37
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:13,540
That didn't improve anything! It sounds like it's 
gonna! Face yourself, I think this behemoth's gonna

38
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:17,324
sneeze! No way!

39
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,315
It feels like we're flying! In case you haven't 
noticed, we are flying! Oh

40
00:05:28,582 --> 00:05:36,274
well, at least we're back on our original course. 
According to the map, we should be spotting the red

41
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:42,524
line any time now.

42
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:45,148
Well, we're almost there! The red line at last! Isn't 
this exciting? We're finally going! We did it! We did

43
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:53,024
it! Cut it out! Sorry. Zoro! You must be right. Is the 
path to the Grand Line really as perilous as it's drawn

44
00:05:58,814 --> 00:06:02,441
here? How's that?

45
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:10,896
Take a look. I'm familiar with the rumors and these 
drawings confirm it. As unimaginable as it may seem,

46
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:19,389
the entrance to the Grand Line is a mountain. 
Mountain? So what, did we crash into it? You gotta be

47
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:23,736
kidding. I didn't believe it, but the map's clear. The 
mountain appears to be riddled with small canals, so

48
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:30,426
we might have to go up and over it. Sounds like fun. What 
are you talking about? Even if there are canals or

49
00:06:35,414 --> 00:06:39,280
whatever, a ship can't climb up a mountain. Well, the 
map says otherwise. That's right, and if Nami thinks

50
00:06:41,282 --> 00:06:43,906
something can be done, then it can. Got that? Yeah, but 
remember, that map was stolen from Buggy the Clown, so

51
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:48,533
can we trust it? It's known as the Rudderstock. A 
little help over here be nice. Sanji, would you please

52
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,484
give Usopp a hand? I can't think with all his shouting. 
Hey, Nami! Okay. Uh, does this current seem unusually

53
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:04,903
strong to anyone else? Usopp, what did you just say? I 
asked if any of you noticed the insane strength of this

54
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:09,072
current. The current? That must be... What is it? The 
canals do go up the mountain. Oh, come on. How could

55
00:07:15,406 --> 00:07:16,708
that possibly work? Look right here. You see? The 
guiding light was directing us toward this spot on the

56
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:21,796
red line. Notice how it's labeled here, reverse 
mountain. Hello? Little help over here, thank you.

57
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:31,330
These green lines represent canals or artificial 
waterways. If major currents from all four oceans

58
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,317
flow toward this mountain, what do you think's going 
to happen? The currents would force water up these

59
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:42,670
canals, collide at the top, and then flow straight 
down into the Grand Line. Now, reverse mountain is a

60
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,516
winter mountain, so it's cold, right? That means any 
surface currents that don't flow up the canal will be

61
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:50,366
forced down as they cool. Anything riding those 
currents would be pulled down as well. If we screw up

62
00:07:53,493 --> 00:08:00,985
and miss the entrance to the canal, the Going Mary will 
be carried straight into the Red Line's rock face and

63
00:07:53,493 --> 00:08:00,985
likely be destroyed. Ship and crew would be sucked to 
the bottom of the sea, understand? Yeah, basically

64
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:09,139
it's a mystery mountain. No, that's not my point at 
all. Anyway, since we're positioned on this current,

65
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:19,079
we shouldn't run into any problems getting to the 
summit of Reverse Mountain. Only thing that would

66
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,244
hurt us now is if something went wrong with the rudder. 
Nami, you're a genius! Call me a skeptic, but ships do

67
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:27,691
not climb mountains. Well, I've heard a few stories. 
Stories about the Mystery Mountain? No. What I have

68
00:08:32,697 --> 00:08:38,164
heard is that more than half the people who try to make 
it to the Grand Line die before they even get there.

69
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:42,721
Whatever we find, it isn't going to be easy. Sanji, 
could you get the sale? Anything for you, Nami! Luffy,

70
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:49,428
help me!

71
00:08:50,469 --> 00:09:01,801
Got it!

72
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:02,001
Hey! I can see the Mystery Mountain! That's insanely 
huge! Wow! Awesome! It's bigger than I thought! I

73
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,976
can't see the top! It's taller than the clouds!

74
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,989
We're all for getting sucked in! Hold the rudder 
steady!

75
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:49,056
We're on it! Nami!

76
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,583
Where's that entrance you were talking about? If we 
keep this heading, we're gonna crash into the rocks!

77
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,111
There's a crack in that cliff. That must be it. Nami! 
Give us a direction! Keep bearing straight ahead! You

78
00:10:10,705 --> 00:10:11,927
can't be serious! Trust me! Have we made it? Is that the 
canal entrance? More than likely. I've gotta be

79
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:19,778
dreaming. It's impossible. The ocean really is 
flowing up the mountain.

80
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:32,296
We have to make our way through those water gates just 
right! Or we'll crash into the red line if he's smashed

81
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:36,222
to pieces!

82
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:49,383
Come

83
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:49,383
on now, put your back into it! The ladder!

84
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,610
I'm gone!

85
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:22,021
Grab a hold!

86
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:29,513
We made

87
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:29,513
it!

88
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:43,896
Now it's just a straight

89
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:43,896
shot to the stomach! Wow! Great view!

90
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:52,270
Wow! Look how high we are! We're in the clouds!

91
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:16,065
We're not in the clouds! We're above

92
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:27,430
them! It's amazing! We've done it! We've reached the 
summit!

93
00:12:49,480 --> 00:13:08,243
I

94
00:12:49,480 --> 00:13:08,243
can see it! This is the greatest sea in the whole world! 
The Grand Lie! Somewhere out there the One Piece is

95
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,255
waiting and we're gonna find it! Let's

96
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,247
go! Did

97
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:38,285
you guys just hear something? It was probably just a 
whiz! At this speed, everything sounds distorted!

98
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:50,867
Nami! I see a mountain up ahead! What? That's 
impossible! But it's right there! I can see it! Who

99
00:13:57,192 --> 00:13:58,433
cares? Go! After we pass the twin caves up ahead, there 
should be nothing but ocean!

100
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,649
It's a black wall! No, it's not! Then what is it?

101
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,423
Should we fight? Idiots? How are we supposed to fight a 
hundred ton whale? Do something! Our path is blocked!

102
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:33,633
How do we escape? Calm down! If this creature looks 
like a giant wall to us, we must be a speck! That's

103
00:14:39,924 --> 00:14:40,505
right! It's highly possible that this thing isn't 
even aware that we're here! We'll run right into it

104
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,794
unless we change course! Look! We can get by on the 
left! Port! Port to port! The rudder's broken! Do

105
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:53,995
something! Anything! Wait! I know! This'll work! It 
has to! Hey! Luffy, what are you doing?

106
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,361
This is pointless! The ship's not gonna turn! Dammit! 
Don't give up!

107
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:45,259
Or is grown. This is

108
00:15:46,002 --> 00:15:50,074
it. Hey, that was my special

109
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:56,374
scene!

110
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:09,685
Damn! Let's get out of here before it's too late! Who am 
I telling me what the heck is going on? It's so big that

111
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:15,853
the cannonball didn't even make it flinch. That or his 
reaction time's really slow. Who cares? At least

112
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:19,077
we're alive!

113
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:26,967
My ears! Just battle! Get away from here!

114
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:42,699
You think you can break my special seat and get away 
with it?

115
00:16:54,397 --> 00:16:55,479
I'm not through with you! There's a lot more with it! 
Shut

116
00:16:56,841 --> 00:17:01,748
up before you kill us!

117
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:32,646
I

118
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:32,646
am not

119
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:32,646
gonna die!

120
00:17:58,141 --> 00:17:58,944
Oh, man. Everyone's been swallowed whole. Hey, you! 
Can you hear me? Spit them out! I want my friends! Damn

121
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,573
you! Where do you think you're going, you jerk? You 
give them back right now, you whale! Listen, you big

122
00:18:17,837 --> 00:18:20,580
food, I'm not gonna ask again! Stop sinking, I mean it! 
My friends and me are on an important adventure! I

123
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:27,668
can't lose them! Give

124
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:35,758
them back!

125
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:53,220
So what do you think? I don't know what to think. Is this 
even real? Because I know exactly what I saw and what I

126
00:18:57,206 --> 00:19:00,892
felt. We were swallowed by the whale.

127
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,039
Is this a dream? Yeah, I'd say that's a fair guess.

128
00:19:14,832 --> 00:19:16,915
Then what's with this island and the house? 
Illusions.

129
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:52,315
Looks

130
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:52,315
like someone's home. Let's hope it's a person. I've 
had it! Let's go! Giant squid, guys with harpoons! And

131
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,247
where is Luffy?

132
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:13,890
I don't know much about whales, but since when do they 
have doors and lighted hallways?

133
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,991
A ship. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! We 
should fire our cannon there! Now! No. Hold on a sec.

134
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,083
Someone's coming out.
