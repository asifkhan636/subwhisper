1
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:17,368
Destiny, fate, dreams. These unstoppable ideals are 
held deep in the heart of man. As long as there are

2
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,912
people who seek freedom in this life, these things 
shall not vanish from the earth.

3
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:59,316
People tell me my head's in the clouds I don't care what 
they say because I'm dreaming of you You are the

4
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:59,316
treasure I found So bright, so bold, it's so elusive 
It's hard to look away Even though it's blinding me

5
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:59,316
There are no words to describe how I feel inside I'm 
really, really stuck on you I have to follow my dreams,

6
00:00:59,296 --> 00:01:02,884
however crazy they seem. And I won't stop till I get 
there, you will see. You're all I need to have the

7
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:09,820
strength to believe. Believe in one.

8
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,415
I'm going to follow my dreams, however crazy they 
seem. I'm going to share them with you, where love's so

9
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:24,721
true. You're all I want, together we can move on, live 
how we want to. There is no limit to us, we have the power

10
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:37,042
of love, and we don't want to live ordinary lives. We 
have a chance to live in paradise, but even

11
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:10,294
What's wrong, huh? You've had that brooding look on 
your face for a while. Yeah, I guess I hoped I was

12
00:02:12,837 --> 00:02:15,059
dreaming. About what? This may sound crazy, but it 
seems to me we're not even moving. You feel that? Now

13
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:31,318
that you mention it, the sail doesn't appear to be 
catching any wind at all.

14
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:35,268
No! We're screwed! We've entered the Calm Belt! The 
Clam Belt? What's that? Calm Belt! A part of the sea

15
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:42,910
where nothing moves the muscles! So there's muscles 
and clams? No!

16
00:02:50,114 --> 00:02:51,818
What was that? An earthquake? A good trick since we're 
at sea. All of this chit-chat isn't going to get us out

17
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:56,911
of here! Fold the sails and start paddling now! We have 
to get back on course! You can count on me! Don't panic.

18
00:03:03,248 --> 00:03:05,012
And besides, this is a sailboat. Why do we need to 
paddle? True. Look, there's no time to argue. Just

19
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,163
shut up and do as I say. At least it's nice and quiet 
here. Fine, if I need to explain it to you, I will. In our

20
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:20,281
haste to escape from the Marines, we ended up going too 
far south, and now we're off course and stuck out here.

21
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:22,165
So we enter the Grand Line? If we were at the Grand Line, 
you think I'd waste my time explaining this? Now look!

22
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:35,046
The Grand Line is sandwiched in the middle between 
these two green areas you see here, you understand?

23
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:39,192
These areas, just as they're labeled, are what's 
called the Calm Belt. That's where we are. Nobody

24
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:45,101
knows why, but inside the Calm Belt, there's no wind 
and no current. It's like a void where everything's

25
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:47,625
stagnant. Given that sailboats move by catching 
winds, this is more than a dangerous region. It can be

26
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:53,333
fatal, get it? Nope, but it sounds like we're in big 
trouble. Well, that explains why we haven't gotten a

27
00:03:56,365 --> 00:03:59,128
single gust of wind. How are we going to get out of this 
if our ship can't move? Maybe the wind will start

28
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:03,813
blowing again. Wind never blows in the Calm Belt. And 
that's not all. There's another good reason that

29
00:04:07,176 --> 00:04:10,160
people call this area dangerous. It's infested 
with... What was that?

30
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:22,913
Here they go!

31
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:32,105
Sea monsters! They're gigantic!

32
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,463
The Calm Belt is also home to the Sea Kings! It's their 
main place for breeding! They're the biggest reason

33
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,293
people can't cross the Calm Belt! Any idea how we get 
out of this? Yes. Everybody, don't move a muscle. We

34
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:58,810
don't want to give them any reason to stick around or 
eat us. Once they're gone, we'll paddle back. Got it?

35
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:05,981
You call that a plan?

36
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:06,322
Shut up! Sorry.

37
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:13,553
That didn't improve anything! It sounds like it's 
gonna! Face yourself, I think this behemoth's gonna

38
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:17,419
sneeze!

39
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:23,901
It feels like we're flying! In case you haven't 
noticed, we are flying! Oh

40
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:36,259
well, at least we're back on our original course. 
According to the map, we should be spotting the red

41
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:39,764
line any time now.

42
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,152
Wow, we're almost there! The grand line at last! Isn't 
this exciting? We're finally going! We did it! We did

43
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:53,039
it! Cut it out! Sorry. Zoro! You must be right. Is the 
path to the Grand Line really as perilous as it's drawn

44
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:02,429
here? Stop that!

45
00:06:09,617 --> 00:06:10,558
Take a look. I'm familiar with the rumors and these 
drawings confirm it. As unimaginable as it may seem,

46
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:19,362
the entrance to the Grand Line is a mountain. So what, 
did we crash into it? You gotta be kidding. I didn't

47
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:25,570
believe it, but the map's clear. The mountain appears 
to be riddled with small canals, so we might have to go

48
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:30,416
up and over it. Sounds like fun. What are you talking 
about? Even if there are canals or whatever, a ship

49
00:06:35,403 --> 00:06:39,027
can't climb up a mountain. Well, the map says 
otherwise. That's right, and if Nami thinks

50
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:44,649
something can be done, then it can't, got that? Yeah, 
but remember, that map was stolen from Buggy the

51
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:48,375
Clown, so can we trust it? It's still known as the 
Rudderstock! A little help over here be nice! Sanji,

52
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:55,165
would you please give Usopp a hand? I can't think with 
all his shouting! Hey, Nami! Okay. Uh, does this

53
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:04,904
current seem unusually strong to anyone else? Usopp, 
what did you just say? I asked if any of you noticed the

54
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:09,074
insane strength of this current. The current? That 
must be... What is it? The canals do go up the mountain.

55
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:15,366
Oh, come on. How could that possibly work? Look right 
here. You see? The guiding light was directing us

56
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:21,796
toward this spot on the red line. Notice how it's 
labeled here, reverse mountain. Hello? Little help

57
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:26,843
over here, thank you. These green lines represent 
canals or artificial waterways. If major currents

58
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,317
from all four oceans flow toward this mountain, what 
do you think's going to happen? The currents would

59
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:42,670
force water up these canals, collide at the top, and 
then flow straight down into the Grand Line. Now,

60
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,516
reverse mountain is a winter mountain, so it's cold, 
right? That means any surface currents that don't

61
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:50,366
flow up the canal will be forced down as they cool. 
Anything riding those currents would be pulled down

62
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:53,513
as well. If we screw up and miss the entrance to the 
canal, the Going Mary will be carried straight into

63
00:07:53,493 --> 00:08:00,986
the Red Line's rock face and likely be destroyed. Ship 
and crew would be sucked to the bottom of the sea.

64
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:05,093
Understand? Yeah, basically it's a mystery 
mountain. No, that's not my point at all. Anyway,

65
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:19,093
since we're positioned on this current, we shouldn't 
run into any problems getting to the summit of Reverse

66
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:19,093
Mountain. Only thing that would hurt us now is if 
something went wrong with the rudder. Nami, you're a

67
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:23,959
genius! Call me a skeptic, but ships do not climb 
mountains. Well, I've heard a few stories. Stories

68
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:31,790
about the Mystery Mountain? No. What I have heard is 
that more than half the people who try to make it to the

69
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:38,198
Grand Line die before they even get there. Whatever we 
find, it isn't going to be easy. Sanji, could you get

70
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:44,582
the sale? Anything for you, Nami! Luffy, help me!

71
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:50,908
Got it!

72
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:01,998
Hey! I can see the Mystery Mountain!

73
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:08,944
That's insanely huge! Wow! Awesome! It's bigger than 
I thought! I can't see the top! It's taller than the

74
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:19,474
clouds!

75
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:43,463
We're getting sucked in! Hold the rudder steady! 
We're on it! Nami!

76
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:55,182
Where's that entrance you were talking about? If we 
keep this heading, we're gonna crash into the rock!

77
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:03,114
There's a crack in that cliff. That must be it. Nami! 
Give us a direction! Keep bearing straight ahead! You

78
00:10:10,707 --> 00:10:11,929
can't be serious! Trust me! Have we made it? Is that the 
canal entrance? More than likely. I've gotta be

79
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:19,764
dreaming. It's impossible. The ocean really is 
flowing up the mountain.

80
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,758
We have to make our way through those water gates just 
right! Or we'll crash into the red line if he's smashed

81
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:35,661
to pieces!

82
00:10:39,326 --> 00:10:40,728
We're drifting off course! Gotta go more to the right! 
Right! The right? Who hit starboard?

83
00:10:47,758 --> 00:10:48,218
Come on now! Put your back into it!

84
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:58,712
That's

85
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:58,712
water! Oh no!

86
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,996
Grab

87
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,996
a hold!

88
00:11:23,564 --> 00:11:33,597
We made it!

89
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:43,905
Now it's just a straight shot to the stomach! Wow! 
Great view!

90
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:53,103
Wow! Look how high we are! We're in the clouds!

91
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,923
We're not in the clouds, we're above them!

92
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:28,281
It's amazing! We've done it! We've reached the 
summit!

93
00:12:49,278 --> 00:13:06,782
I

94
00:12:49,278 --> 00:13:06,782
can see

95
00:12:49,278 --> 00:13:06,782
it! This is the greatest sea in the whole world! The 
Grand Line! Somewhere out there the One Piece is

96
00:13:14,473 --> 00:13:18,238
waiting and we're gonna find it! Let's

97
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:36,617
go! Did you guys just hear something? It was probably 
just a whiz! At this speed, everything sounds

98
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:47,989
distorted!

99
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,503
What's that? Nami! I see a mountain up ahead! What? 
That's impossible! But it's right there! I can see it!

100
00:13:57,193 --> 00:13:59,737
Who cares? Go! After we pass the twin caves up ahead, 
there should be nothing but ocean!

101
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,427
It's a black wall! No, it's not! But what is it?

102
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,482
It's a whale! What are we gonna do? Should we fight? 
Idiots, how are we supposed to fight a hundred ton

103
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:30,531
whale? Do something! Our path is blocked! How do we 
escape? Calm down. If this creature looks like a giant

104
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,874
wall to us, we must be a speck! That's right! It's 
highly possible that this thing isn't even aware that

105
00:14:40,735 --> 00:14:43,658
we're here! We'll run right into it unless we change 
course! Look! We can get by on the left! Port! Port to

106
00:14:50,404 --> 00:14:51,325
port! The rudder's broken! Do something! Anything! 
Wait! I know! This'll work! It has to! Hey! Luffy! What

107
00:15:00,754 --> 00:15:02,796
are you doing?

108
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:10,730
This is pointless! The ship's not gonna turn! Dammit! 
Don't give up!

109
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,984
Oh, it's good. This is

110
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:50,076
it. Hey, that was my special scene!

111
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,675
Damn! Let's get out of here before it's too late! Don't 
mind telling me what the heck is going on! It's so big

112
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,822
that the cannonball didn't even make it flinch. That 
or his reaction time's really slow. Who cares? At

113
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:25,554
least we're alive!

114
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:26,896
My ears! Just battle! We have to get away from here! 
Luffy? You think you can break my special seat? Get

115
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,503
away with it! Take it! You moron!

116
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:55,484
I'm not through with you! There's a lot more with it! 
Shut up before you kill us!

117
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:32,663
I

118
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:32,663
am

119
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:32,663
not gonna

120
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:32,663
die!

121
00:17:58,141 --> 00:17:58,943
Oh, man. Everyone's been swallowed whole. Hey, you! 
Can you hear me? Spit him out! I want my friends! Damn

122
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:09,003
you! Where do you think you're going, you jerk? You 
give them back right now, you whale! Listen, you big

123
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:20,381
food, I'm not gonna ask again! Stop sinking, I mean it! 
My friends and me are on an important adventure! I

124
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:27,508
can't lose them! Give them back!

125
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:53,220
So what do you think? I don't know what to think. Is this 
even real? Because I know exactly what I saw and what I

126
00:18:57,203 --> 00:19:00,887
felt. We were swallowed by the whale.

127
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:06,032
Is this a dream? Yeah, I'd say that's a fair guess.

128
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,902
Then what's with this island and the house? 
Illusions.

129
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:52,364
Looks

130
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:52,364
like someone's home. Let's hope it's a person. I've 
had it. Let's go. Giant squids, guys with harpoons?

131
00:19:59,594 --> 00:20:00,815
And where is Luffy?

132
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:05,962
Yeah, where is he? I don't know much about whales, but 
since when do they have doors and lighted hallways?

133
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:14,372
A ship. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! We 
should fire our cannon there! No! No. Hold on a sec.

134
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:23,083
Someone's coming out.
