1
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:21,351
I can't believe it. I can't 
believe it.

2
00:02:08,686 --> 00:02:09,988
How was it, Zoro? It's hard to 
face from just before. No, I

3
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,517
don't think so. What? It's 
from just before. I feel like

4
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:25,193
this ship doesn't move.

5
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:27,557
What? I mean, Hoga doesn't 
have a wind.

6
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:36,708
It's over! I got into the carm 
belt! What's that? Carm

7
00:02:39,971 --> 00:02:41,652
belt! It's the name of the 
carm belt! What's the name of

8
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:49,460
the carm belt? What's the 
name of the carm belt? What's

9
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:53,123
the name of the carm belt? 
What's the name of the carm

10
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:55,145
belt? What's the name of the 
carm belt? What's the name of

11
00:02:57,447 --> 00:02:58,488
the carm belt? What's the 
name of the carm belt? What's

12
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:02,031
the name of the carm belt? 
What are you doing? It's a

13
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:05,400
ship. It's a ship. That's 
right. Don't you tell me what

14
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:10,305
you're saying. It's a 
difficult thing. It's not a

15
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:14,989
ship. Well, I'll explain it. 
Okay? I'm going to go away

16
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:24,979
from this ship, so I'm going 
to go to the front of the ship.

17
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:26,080
So, Grand Line in? Wow! 
That's how easy it is! That's

18
00:03:28,302 --> 00:03:30,988
good! The Grand Line that 
we're looking for are more

19
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:36,019
than 2 different areas. Do 
you understand? This 2

20
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:41,571
different areas are called 
the Carmel Belt. I don't know

21
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:44,978
why, but if it doesn't, it 
doesn't have a river. It's a

22
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,962
complete state of the state 
of the sea! It's a dangerous

23
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:48,983
place for the wind! It's a 
dangerous place for the

24
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:50,966
wind! Did you understand it? 
Yes, it's a difficult thing.

25
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:56,253
It's the only way that the 
wind blows up. You can't do

26
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:57,855
it. You can't do it. You can't 
do it. You can't do it. That's

27
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,382
why! If you enter the sea of 
the sea of the sea of the sea of

28
00:04:02,402 --> 00:04:12,315
the sea of the sea of the sea of 
the sea of the sea of the sea of

29
00:04:02,402 --> 00:04:12,315
the sea of the sea of the sea of 
the sea of the sea of the sea of

30
00:04:02,402 --> 00:04:12,315
the sea!

31
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:34,671
Wow!

32
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,333
Wow! Wow!

33
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:40,999
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! 
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!

34
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:45,865
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! 
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! How

35
00:04:50,281 --> 00:04:56,089
are you going to do this 
situation? Let's go,

36
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:57,111
everyone. I'll go back to the 
ship, so I'll go back

37
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:13,874
to the ship.

38
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:14,555
I'm going to go back to the 
ship. I'm going to go back to

39
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:15,236
the ship. I'm going to go back 
to the ship. I'm going to go

40
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:17,219
back to the ship. I'm going to 
go back to the ship. I'm going

41
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:19,242
back to the ship.

42
00:05:23,693 --> 00:05:33,750
Really, I'm going to

43
00:05:23,693 --> 00:05:33,750
fly! It's like you came back 
to the original road. It's

44
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:39,559
time to see a red line.

45
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:46,714
It's the Grand Line!

46
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,168
It's the same thing!

47
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:57,635
It's the same thing! It's the 
same thing! It's the same

48
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:02,625
thing! It's the

49
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:06,913
same thing!

50
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:16,024
I've heard of it, but I've 
heard of it, but I've heard of

51
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:16,024
it as well. If it's like that, 
the Grand Line is a mountain.

52
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:21,311
The mountain? The mountain? 
What did you say? What did you

53
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:25,076
say? I thought I was thinking 
about it, but there's a

54
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:29,182
mountain on the mountain. 
It's a mountain on the

55
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:32,786
mountain. It's a mountain on 
the mountain. Oh, that's

56
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,351
interesting. What are you 
saying? The mountain on the

57
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:39,195
mountain is climbing on the 
mountain. That's it, it's

58
00:06:39,293 --> 00:06:43,381
written in there. So, that's 
what you're saying! That's

59
00:06:45,224 --> 00:06:46,286
what you're saying! That's 
what you're buying from

60
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:50,113
Buggies, right? That's what 
you're saying. What's that?

61
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,459
Don't worry! Don't worry, 
don't worry, don't worry,

62
00:06:53,479 --> 00:07:00,272
don't worry, don't worry, 
don't worry, don't worry,

63
00:06:53,479 --> 00:07:00,272
don't worry, don't worry, 
don't worry, don't worry,

64
00:06:53,479 --> 00:07:00,272
don't worry It's... It's... 
It's...

65
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:21,501
It's... It's... It's... 
It's... It's...

66
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:21,501
It's... Red Line in the river 
mountain. What are you

67
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:28,185
doing? There is a sea sea sea 
sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea

68
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:42,493
sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea 
sea sea The reverse mountain

69
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:54,542
is a spring island, so the red 
line of the river is on the

70
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:54,542
coast from the coast of the 
coast of the coast. If you

71
00:07:55,503 --> 00:08:02,731
don't know about the boat, 
the Boeing Marine号 is on the

72
00:07:55,503 --> 00:08:02,731
edge of the coast of the 
coast, and the ship is

73
00:07:55,503 --> 00:08:02,731
destroyed. It's like the sea 
of the moxu, right? Yes, I

74
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:06,896
see. It's a strange 
mountain, isn't it? Well, I

75
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,902
don't know. But anyway, 
we're going to get into the

76
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:22,729
sea, so if we're going to get 
to the river mountain

77
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:22,729
mountain, we'll be able to go 
to the river mountain

78
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:22,729
mountain. Oh, wow! I didn't 
hear that. I've heard of a

79
00:08:25,493 --> 00:08:29,118
mountain in the sea. I have a 
little bit. What's that? No.

80
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:40,436
Grand Line is going to go in 
the front of us, but we don't

81
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:40,436
know if we can't. We don't 
know if we can't. Come on,

82
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,805
please! Yes,

83
00:08:45,865 --> 00:09:03,110
Nani! Come on, Nani! Come on, 
Nani! Come on, Nani! Come on,

84
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:08,337
Nani! Come on, Nani! Wow! 
That's the best

85
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:16,983
line! There's no one in the 
sky!

86
00:09:39,923 --> 00:10:03,214
Oh, that崖

87
00:09:39,923 --> 00:10:03,214
of

88
00:09:39,923 --> 00:10:03,214
hibber!

89
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:08,790
How are you? Go ahead! Go 
ahead! I'll do it! I'll do it!

90
00:10:15,637 --> 00:10:17,679
I'll do it! I'll do it! I'll do 
it! I'll do it!

91
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:30,052
I'll do it! I'll do it! I'll do 
it! I'll do it! I'll do it!

92
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:34,656
I'll do it! I'll do it! I'll do 
it!

93
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:59,509
It's not going to

94
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:59,509
go!

95
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:22,051
Take

96
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:22,051
it!

97
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:40,840
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

98
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:46,495
Wow!

99
00:11:50,619 --> 00:12:13,246
It's

100
00:11:50,619 --> 00:12:13,246
in

101
00:11:50,619 --> 00:12:13,246
the sky! Wow! Look! It's on

102
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:27,592
top! Look! It's on top! It's 
on top!

103
00:13:06,473 --> 00:13:08,480
Look! This is the most 
beautiful sea of the world!

104
00:13:14,823 --> 00:13:15,465
The Grand Line! There's one 
piece in this place!

105
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,213
Do you hear anything? It's 
not a wind sound.

106
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,002
There are many places there. 
What? There's a mountain!

107
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:55,428
There's a mountain! There's 
no mountain! There's no

108
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:57,510
mountain! There's no 
mountain! There's no

109
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:58,672
mountain! There's no 
mountain! There's no

110
00:13:59,212 --> 00:13:59,833
mountain! There's no 
mountain! There's no

111
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:01,434
mountain! There's no 
mountain! There's no

112
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:03,176
mountain! There's no 
mountain!

113
00:14:13,147 --> 00:14:16,472
What's that? What's that? 
What's that? What's that?

114
00:14:20,138 --> 00:14:24,765
What's

115
00:14:20,138 --> 00:14:24,765
that? What's that? What's 
that? What's that? What's

116
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:27,349
that? What's that? What's 
that? What's that? What's

117
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:31,576
that? What's that? What's 
that? What's that? What's

118
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,026
that? What's that? Sokka, I 
don't have to know what

119
00:14:40,248 --> 00:14:46,378
you're doing! You're stuck 
with me! Hey! I'm going to go

120
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:49,963
left! I'm going to go! I'm 
going to go! I'm going to go!

121
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,270
I'm going to go! I'm going to 
go! I'm going to go! I'm going

122
00:14:55,673 --> 00:14:57,295
to go! I'm going to go! I'm 
going to go!

123
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:17,529
I

124
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:17,529
can't

125
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:17,529
do it! I can't do it!

126
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:34,088
I can't do it!

127
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:35,730
I can't do it! Okay, did you 
stop?

128
00:15:42,888 --> 00:16:08,659
I...

129
00:15:42,888 --> 00:16:08,659
I... I...

130
00:15:42,888 --> 00:16:08,659
I... I... I... I...

131
00:15:42,888 --> 00:16:08,659
I...

132
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:11,412
Let's go! Let's go! What the 
hell are you doing? I'm not

133
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:14,977
going to kill you! I'm not 
going to kill you! I'm not

134
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:18,962
going to kill you! I'm

135
00:16:18,982 --> 00:16:25,331
not going to kill you! I'm not 
going to kill you! I'm not

136
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:27,755
going to kill you! I'm not 
going to kill you! I'm not

137
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:36,447
going

138
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:36,447
to kill you! Luffy? What are 
you going to do with me?

139
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:56,280
What are you going to do with 
me?

140
00:17:57,955 --> 00:18:00,928
I... I... I... I... I... I...

141
00:18:17,885 --> 00:18:21,694
I'll be back! I'll be back!

142
00:18:47,146 --> 00:18:55,458
What

143
00:18:47,146 --> 00:18:55,458
do you think? What do you 
think? What do you think?

144
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,242
What do you think? What do you 
think? What do you think?

145
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:00,705
What do you think? What do you 
think? What do you think?

146
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:05,392
What do you think? What do you 
think? What do you think?

147
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:09,137
What do you think?

148
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:18,210
So, what is that island and 
house? It's a幻,

149
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:23,974
right? So, what is this?

150
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:56,814
There's a lot of people, 
right? It's a lot of people,

151
00:19:57,775 --> 00:20:05,163
but... I don't want to go 
back.

152
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:07,065
I'm going back to Ruffy. How 
is it going? So, Ruffy...

153
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:09,688
What is this? Why do

154
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:16,475
you have a door on a horse and a 
door on a horse? What's that?

155
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:17,757
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! 
Let's go! Just wait. Someone

156
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:23,640
came out.
