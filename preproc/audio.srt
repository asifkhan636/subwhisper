1
00:00:14,527 --> 00:00:15,828
Fate. Dreams. These unstoppable ideals are held deep 
in the heart of man. As long as there are people who seek

2
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:35,129
freedom in this life, these things shall not vanish 
from the earth.

3
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:37,992
People tell me my head's in the clouds. I don't care 
what they say because I'm dreaming of you. You are the

4
00:00:42,257 --> 00:00:42,677
treasure.

5
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,312
What's wrong, huh? You've had that brooding look on 
your face for a while. Yeah, I guess I hoped I was

6
00:02:12,837 --> 00:02:15,041
dreaming. About what? This may sound crazy, but it 
seems to me we're not even moving. You feel that?

7
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:31,453
Now that you mention it, the sail doesn't appear to be 
catching any wind at all.

8
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,281
No! We're screwed! We've entered the Calm Belt! The 
Clam Belt? What's that? Calm Belt! A part of the sea

9
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,927
where nothing moves a muscle! So there's muscles and 
clams? No!

10
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,678
What

11
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,678
was that, an earthquake? A good trick since we're at 
sea. All of this chit-chat isn't going to get us out of

12
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:56,906
here. Fold the sails and start paddling now. We have to 
get back on course. You can count on me! Don't panic.

13
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:05,001
And besides, this is a sailboat. Why do we need to 
paddle? True. Look, there's no time to argue. Just

14
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:10,171
shut up and do as I say. At least it's nice and quiet 
here. Fine, if I need to explain it to you, I will. In our

15
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:20,290
haste to escape from the Marines, we ended up going too 
far south, and now we're off course and stuck out here.

16
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,897
So we enter the Grand Line? Woo-hoo-hoo! If we were at 
the Grand Line, you think I'd waste my time explaining

17
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:27,584
this? Now look. The Grand Line is sandwiched in the 
middle between these two green areas you see here, you

18
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:36,055
understand? These areas, just as they're labeled, 
are what's called the Calm Belt. That's where we are.

19
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,144
Nobody knows why, but inside the Calm Belt, there's no 
wind and no current. It's like a void where

20
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:47,606
everything's stagnant. Given that sailboats move by 
catching winds, this is more than a dangerous region,

21
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:53,652
it can be fatal, get it? Nope, but it sounds like we're 
in big trouble. Well, that explains why we haven't

22
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:59,059
gotten a single gust of wind. How are we going to get out 
of this if our ship can't move? Maybe the wind will

23
00:04:01,863 --> 00:04:03,506
start blowing again. Wind never blows in the Calm 
Belt. And that's not all. There's another good reason

24
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:10,736
that people call this area dangerous. It's infested 
with... What was that?

25
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:23,335
Here they come!

26
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:32,143
Sea monsters! They're gigantic!

27
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:42,399
The Calm Belt is also home to the Sea Kings! It's their 
main place for breeding! They're the biggest reason

28
00:04:44,863 --> 00:04:48,208
people can't cross the Calm Belt! any idea how we get 
out of this? Yes. Everybody, don't move a muscle. We

29
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:58,810
don't want to give them any reason to stick around or 
eat us. Once they're gone, we'll paddle back. Got it?

30
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:06,002
You call that a plan?

31
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:06,382
Shut up! Sorry.

32
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:13,553
That didn't improve anything! It sounds like it's 
gonna! Waste yourselves, I think this behemoth's

33
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:17,319
gonna sneeze! No!

34
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:28,548
In case you haven't noticed, we are flying! Oh

35
00:05:28,568 --> 00:05:36,263
well, at least we're back on our original course. 
According to the map, we should be spotting the red

36
00:05:36,744 --> 00:05:40,772
line any time now.

37
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,663
Wow, we're almost there, the grand line at last! Isn't 
this exciting? We're finally going! We did it! We did

38
00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:53,017
it! Cut it out! Sorry. Zoro! You must be right. Is the 
path to the Grand Line really as perilous as it's drawn

39
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:02,413
here? Stop that!

40
00:06:09,646 --> 00:06:10,407
Take a look. I'm familiar with the rumors, and these 
drawings confirm it. As unimaginable as it may seem,

41
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:19,519
the entrance to the Grand Line is a mountain. 
Mountain? So what, did we crash into it? You gotta be

42
00:06:22,422 --> 00:06:23,743
kidding. I didn't believe it, but the map's clear. The 
mountain appears to be riddled with small canals, so

43
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:30,431
we might have to go up and over it. Sounds like fun. What 
are you talking about? Even if there are canals or

44
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:39,060
whatever, a ship can't climb up a mountain. Well, the 
map says otherwise. That's right, and if Nami thinks

45
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:44,645
something can be done, then it can't, got that? Yeah, 
but remember, that map was stolen from Buggy the

46
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:52,298
Clown, so can we trust if... In case they've noticed 
the rudder's stuck, a little help over here be nice!

47
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,624
Sanji, would you please give Usopp a hand? I can't 
think with all his shouting. It's terrible right

48
00:06:57,447 --> 00:06:58,649
away, Nami! Okay. Uh, does this current seem 
unusually strong to anyone else? Usopp, what did you

49
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:06,282
just say? I asked if any of you noticed the insane 
strength of this current. The current? That must

50
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,087
be... What is it? The canals do go up the mountain. Oh, 
come on. How could that possibly work? Look right

51
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:17,712
here. You see? The guiding light was directing us 
toward this spot on the red line. Notice how it's

52
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,058
labeled here. Reverse mountain. Hello? Little help 
over here, thank you! These green lines represent

53
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:31,008
canals or artificial waterways. If major currents 
from all four oceans flow toward this mountain, what

54
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:36,334
do you think's gonna happen? The currents would force 
water up these canals, collide at the top, and then

55
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:42,200
flow straight down into the Grand Line. Now, Reverse 
Mountain is a winter mountain, so it's cold, right?

56
00:07:45,984 --> 00:07:50,348
That means any surface currents that don't flow up the 
canal will be forced down as they cool. Anything

57
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:52,891
riding those currents would be pulled down as well. If 
we screw up and miss the entrance to the canal, the

58
00:07:53,612 --> 00:08:01,680
Going Mary will be carried straight into the Red 
Line's rock face and likely be destroyed. Ship and

59
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,444
crew would be sucked to the bottom of the sea. 
Understand? Yeah. Basically, it's a mystery

60
00:08:06,307 --> 00:08:08,210
mountain.

61
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:13,619
No, that's not my point at all. Anyway, since we're 
positioned on this current, we shouldn't run into any

62
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,107
problems getting to the summit of Reverse Mountain. 
Only thing that would hurt us now is if something went

63
00:08:19,308 --> 00:08:22,172
wrong with the rudder. Nami, you're a genius! Call me a 
skeptic, but ships do not climb mountains. Well, I've

64
00:08:27,952 --> 00:08:29,735
heard a few stories. Stories about the Mystery 
Mountain? No. What I have heard is that more than half

65
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:38,989
the people who try to make it to the Grand Line die 
before they even get there. Whatever we find, it isn't

66
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:42,734
going to be easy. Sanji, could you get the sail? 
Anything for you, Nami! Luffy, help me!

67
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:51,107
Got it!

68
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:01,950
Hey! I can see the mystery mountain!

69
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:10,548
That's insanely huge! Wow! Awesome! It's bigger than 
I thought! I can't see the top! It's taller than the

70
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,727
clouds!

71
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:43,671
We're

72
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:43,671
getting sucked in! Hold the rudder steady! We're on 
it! Nami! Where's that entrance you were talking

73
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:55,530
about? If we keep this heading, we're gonna crash into 
the rocks!

74
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,828
There's a crack in that cliff. That must be it. Nami! 
Give us a direction! Keep bearing straight ahead! You

75
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:11,921
can't be serious! Trust me! Have we made it? Is that the 
canal entrance? More than likely. I've got to be

76
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,855
dreaming. It's impossible. The ocean really is 
flowing up the mountain.

77
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,760
We have to make our way through those water gates just 
right! Or we'll crash into the red line if he's smashed

78
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,685
to pieces!

79
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:40,735
We're drifting off course! Gotta go more to the right! 
Right! Go right? Who hit starboard? Come

80
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:48,249
on now! Put your back into it! Gah!

81
00:10:55,355 --> 00:11:12,264
Dumb

82
00:10:55,355 --> 00:11:12,264
gum balloon!

83
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:13,145
Luffy! Drop a hold!

84
00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:43,910
Now

85
00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:43,910
it's just a screenshot to the

86
00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:43,910
stomach! Wow, great view!

87
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,434
Whoa!

88
00:11:53,594 --> 00:12:01,504
Look how high we are! We're in the

89
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:10,736
clouds!

90
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:14,921
This is insane!

91
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:18,906
We're not in the clouds, we're above them!

92
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:28,356
It's amazing!

93
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:28,959
We've done it! We've reached the summit!

94
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:07,590
I can see it! This is the greatest sea in the whole 
world! The Grand Line! Somewhere out there the One

95
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:19,491
Piece is waiting and we're gonna find it! Let's

96
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:31,772
go!

97
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:38,270
Did you guys just hear something? It was probably just 
the wind! At this speed, everything sounds

98
00:13:41,475 --> 00:13:43,277
distorted!

99
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:50,668
What was that? Nami! I see a mountain up ahead! What? 
That's impossible! But it's right there! I can see it!

100
00:13:57,197 --> 00:13:59,240
Who cares? Go! After we pass the twin capes up ahead, 
there should be nothing but ocean!

101
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,153
It's a black wall! No, it's not! Then what is it?

102
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:25,026
It's a whale! What are we gonna do? Should we fight? 
Idiots, how are we supposed to fight a hundred ton

103
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,654
whale? We have to do something! Our path is blocked! 
How do we escape? Calm down. If this creature looks

104
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,916
like a giant wall to us, we must be a speck! That's 
right! It's highly possible that this thing isn't

105
00:14:40,757 --> 00:14:43,540
even aware that we're here! We'll run right into it 
unless we change course! Look! We can get by on the

106
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:49,628
left! Port! Port to port! The rudder's broken! Do 
something! Anything! Wait! I know! This'll work! It

107
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:59,922
has to! Hey! Luffy, what are you doing?

108
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:10,369
This is pointless! The ship's not gonna turn! Damn it! 
Don't give up!

109
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:24,749
Is this the end? The cannon!

110
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:36,225
Done.

111
00:15:44,491 --> 00:15:49,763
Or

112
00:15:44,491 --> 00:15:49,763
is it? Or is it? Hey, that was my special scene!

113
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:09,686
Damn! Let's get out of here before it's too late! 
Someone mind telling me what the heck is going on! It's

114
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,854
so big that the cannonball didn't even make it flinch. 
That or his reaction time's really slow. Who cares? At

115
00:16:18,116 --> 00:16:25,565
least we're alive!

116
00:16:25,606 --> 00:16:27,127
My ears! Just battle! We have to get away from here!

117
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:36,951
Luffy? You think you can break my special seat and get 
away with it? Take this! You moron!

118
00:16:54,423 --> 00:16:55,485
I'm not through with you! There's a lot more with it!

119
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:31,971
I am not gonna die!

120
00:17:58,158 --> 00:17:58,940
Oh, man. Everyone's been swallowed whole. Hey, you! 
Can you hear me? Spit them out! I want my friends! Damn

121
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:07,538
you! Where do you think you're going, you jerk? You 
give them back right now, you will! Listen, you big

122
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:20,699
boot, I'm not gonna ask again! Stop sinking, I mean it! 
My friends and me are on an important adventure! I

123
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:27,530
can't lose them! Give them back!

124
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:53,741
So,

125
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:53,741
what do you think? I don't know what to think. Is this 
even real? Because I know exactly what I saw and what I

126
00:18:57,206 --> 00:19:00,912
felt. We were swallowed by the whale.

127
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:06,040
Is this a dream? Yeah, I'd say that's a fair guess.

128
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,897
Then what's with this island and the house? 
Illusions.

129
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,594
Um, that looks like... A great game square!

130
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:52,308
Looks like someone's home. Let's hope it's a person. 
I've had it. Let's go. Giant squids, guys with

131
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:59,574
harpoons? And where is Luffy? Yeah, where

132
00:20:02,597 --> 00:20:05,960
is he? I don't know much about whales, but since when do 
they have doors and lighted hallways?

133
00:20:13,906 --> 00:20:14,367
A ship. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! We 
should fire our cannon there! Now! No. Hold on a sec.

134
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:23,134
Someone's coming out.
