1
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:19,379
Destiny, fate, dreams. These unstoppable
ideals are held deep in the heart of man.

2
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:41,063
People tell me my head's in the clouds I
don't care what they say because I'm

3
00:00:59,296 --> 00:01:05,296
I have to follow my dreams, however crazy
they seem. And I won't stop till I get

4
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:24,550
I'm going to follow my dreams, however
crazy they seem. I'm going to share them

5
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:14,652
What's wrong, huh? You've had that
brooding look on your face for a while.

6
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:40,927
No! We're screwed! We've entered the Calm
Belt! The Clam Belt? What's that? Calm

7
00:02:50,114 --> 00:02:56,114
What was that? An earthquake? A good trick
since we're at sea. All of this chit-chat

8
00:03:06,837 --> 00:03:12,837
Look, there's no time to argue. Just shut
up and do as I say. At least it's nice and

9
00:03:28,015 --> 00:03:34,015
Now look! The Grand Line is sandwiched in
the middle between these two green areas

10
00:03:56,365 --> 00:04:02,365
Well, that explains why we haven't gotten
a single gust of wind. How are we going to

11
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:36,082
Sea monsters! They're gigantic! The Calm
Belt is also home to the Sea Kings! It's

12
00:04:50,197 --> 00:04:56,197
Any idea how we get out of this? Yes.
Everybody, don't move a muscle. We don't

13
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:27,297
It feels like we're flying! In case you
haven't noticed, we are flying! Oh well,

14
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:53,133
Isn't this exciting? We're finally going!
We did it! We did it! Cut it out! Sorry.

15
00:06:11,753 --> 00:06:17,753
I'm familiar with the rumors and these
drawings confirm it. As unimaginable as it

16
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:45,462
Well, the map says otherwise. That's
right, and if Nami thinks something can be

17
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:06,674
Uh, does this current seem unusually
strong to anyone else? Usopp, what did you

18
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:20,545
Oh, come on. How could that possibly work?
Look right here. You see? The guiding

19
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:42,297
The currents would force water up these
canals, collide at the top, and then flow

20
00:07:53,493 --> 00:07:59,493
If we screw up and miss the entrance to
the canal, the Going Mary will be carried

21
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:15,220
No, that's not my point at all. Anyway,
since we're positioned on this current, we

22
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:44,937
Whatever we find, it isn't going to be
easy. Sanji, could you get the sale?

23
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:16,105
Wow! Awesome! It's bigger than I thought!
I can't see the top! It's taller than the

24
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:46,058
We're getting sucked in! Hold the rudder
steady! We're on it! Nami! Where's that

25
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:12,299
Nami! Give us a direction! Keep bearing
straight ahead! You can't be serious!

26
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:35,333
We have to make our way through those
water gates just right! Or we'll crash

27
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:19,090
Grab a hold! We made it!

28
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:44,133
Now it's just a straight shot to the
stomach! Wow! Great view! Wow! Look how

29
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,920
We're not in the clouds, we're above them!
It's amazing! We've done it! We've reached

30
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:55,278
I can see it! This is the greatest sea in
the whole world! The Grand Line! Somewhere

31
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Let's go! Did you guys just hear
something? It was probably just a whiz! At

32
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,880
What's that? Nami! I see a mountain up
ahead! What? That's impossible! But it's

33
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:19,400
It's a black wall! No, it's not! But what
is it? It's a whale! What are we gonna do?

34
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:41,590
If this creature looks like a giant wall
to us, we must be a speck! That's right!

35
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:14,564
This is pointless! The ship's not gonna
turn! Dammit! Don't give up!

36
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:49,276
Oh, it's good. This is it. Hey, that was
my special scene!

37
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:14,133
Damn! Let's get out of here before it's
too late! Don't mind telling me what the

38
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:41,892
Luffy? You think you can break my special
seat? Get away with it! Take it! You

39
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:14,512
I am not gonna die!

40
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:04,141
Oh, man. Everyone's been swallowed whole.
Hey, you! Can you hear me? Spit him out! I

41
00:18:12,113 --> 00:18:18,113
You give them back right now, you whale!
Listen, you big food, I'm not gonna ask

42
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:57,618
So what do you think? I don't know what to
think. Is this even real? Because I know

43
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:30,507
Looks like someone's home. Let's hope it's
a person.

44
00:19:55,068 --> 00:20:01,068
I've had it. Let's go. Giant squids, guys
with harpoons? And where is Luffy? Yeah,
